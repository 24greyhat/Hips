# Hidden In Plain Sight (HIPS)

<hr/>

#### A simple tool that converts any data into hex and encodes it into spaces, tabs, and newline characters and can easily decode the obfuscated data back to string format.

## This tool is simple but very useful for hiding shellcode in plain sight.

### just run the hips.py file to see it in action! (uses one builtin module)


#### You can pass the Hips class your custom mapping of what each hex char should map to.
